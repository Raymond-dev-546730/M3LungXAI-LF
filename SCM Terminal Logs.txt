Fold 1/3
Some weights of BertForTokenClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at SpanBERT/spanbert-large-cased and are newly initialized: ['classifier.bias', 'classifier.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
